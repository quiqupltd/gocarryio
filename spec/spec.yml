      summary: Create Shipment
      description: |-
        The **Create Shipment** endpoint allows the creation of a new shipment in Carriyo, generating a unique shipment ID. Merchants can specify a particular carrier account or rely on Carriyo to automatically assign a carrier based on predefined automation rules.

        ### Key Concepts

        ---

        #### Forward vs Reverse Shipments

        This endpoint supports the creation of both **forward** and **reverse** shipments, determined by the `entity_type` parameter:

        - **Forward Shipment**: Standard shipment from the merchant to the customer.
        - **Reverse Shipment**: Return shipment, where the customer sends items back to the merchant.

        ---

        #### Draft, Confirmed, and Prebooked Shipments

        You can create a shipment as either a **draft**, **confirmed**, or **prebooked** shipment:

        - **Draft Shipments**:
          - Used to create a shipment in Carriyo for initial visibility before processing is complete. This is useful when shipment details (e.g., parcel information) arenâ€™t yet available.
          - Setting the `draft` query parameter to `true` creates the shipment in draft status without booking it with a carrier.
          - Draft shipments remain unbooked until confirmed, and they are not sent to the carrier.

        - **Confirmed Shipments**:
          - If the `draft` query parameter is omitted or set to `false`, Carriyo treats the shipment as confirmed, assigns it to a carrier, and immediately initiates a booking request.
          - **Pending Status**: If Carriyoâ€™s validations pass and a valid carrier is assigned, the status is set to **pending**, and Carriyo sends the booking request to the carrier.
            > *Note:* The API will respond with the status `pending`, without waiting for the carrier's response.
          - **Error Status**: If Carriyoâ€™s validations fail, the shipment status is set to **error**, and the response will include specific error details.

        - **Prebooked Shipments**:
          - If you wish to track a shipment already booked outside Carriyo, create a **prebooked shipment** by setting the `pre_booked` parameter to `true` and providing the carrierâ€™s prebooking information, such as in this example:

            ```json
            {
              "pre_booked": true,
              "pre_booking_info": {
                "input_carrier": "DHL",
                "carrier_tracking_no": "1234567890"
              }
            }
            ```

        ---

        #### Shipment Booking and Status Updates

        Once Carriyo sends the booking request to the carrier:

        - **Successful Booking**: If the carrier successfully books the shipment, Carriyo updates the shipment status to **booked** and assigns the carrier tracking number.
        - **Booking Error**: If the carrier rejects the booking request, the shipment status is updated to **error**.

        After booking, a label is generated, and Carriyo pushes all status updates, including label details, back to the merchant via webhooks.

        This endpoint is used to update a draft shipment. If a shipment is already confirmed, then the endpoint will return a 400 error.

        1. This endpoint supports partial updates. You can partially update certain sections of the shipment without updating the rest of the shipment.
        2. Partial updates are applied to top level shipment attributes. For example, if you pass the pickup element in the request, then all the pickup fields in the object will be replaced with the new payload.
        3. The above rule does not apply to custom attributes. Custom attributes can be individually added, updated or removed. To remove a custom attribute, you may pass a null value.

        The `shipment_id` is used as a path parameter to identify the shipment. Alternatively the merchant provided shipment reference (`partner_shipment_reference`) can also be used instead of the `shipment_id`.

      summary: Confirm Shipment
      description: |-
        This endpoint is intended to confirm a `draft` shipment.

        **Please Note: The request body is optional when you use this endpoint. You can optionally update the shipment data when confirming the shipment.**
        1. This endpoint supports partial updates. You can partially update certain sections of the shipment without updating the rest of the shipment.
        2. Partial updates are applied to top level shipment attributes. For example, if you pass the pickup element in the request, then all the pickup fields in the object will be replaced with the new payload.
        3. The above rule does not apply to custom attributes. Custom attributes can be individually added, updated or removed. To remove a custom attribute, you may pass a null value.

        Once the shipment is confirmed, the shipment is set to pending status, a carrier is assigned, and a booking request is sent to the assigned carrier. The endpoint returns the shipment  immediately in the pending status, without waiting for a response from the carrier.

        If the carrier successfully confirms the booking, the shipment status is updated to booked, along with the tracking number. If the carrier rejects the booking request, the shipment status is set to error.

        The merchant is notified of the booking update and the subsequent label generation  via webhooks.

        The `shipment_id` is used as a path parameter to identify the shipment. Alternatively the merchant shipment reference (`partner_shipment_reference`) can also be used instead of the `shipment_id`.

        * To retry the shipment, original carrier account object should be specified in request.
        * To reassign the shipment, target carrier account should be specified in the request.
        * If no carrier account object specified, the rules engine will trigger to find the best suitable one.
        * Otherwise, operation has no effect.

        This endpoint is used to reprocess shipments that are in the `error` status due to failure during booking. It can also be used to reprocess shipments that have been `cancelled` or `returned`. The entire shipment object is required to be passed in the request to reprocess a shipment.

        The `shipment_id` is used as a path parameter to identify the shipment. Alternatively the merchant provided shipment reference (`partner_shipment_reference`) can also be used instead of the `shipment_id`.

      summary: Ready to Ship
      description: |-
        This endpoint sets the shipment as ready-to-ship, and for carriers that support scheduling of collection, it notifies them of the scheduled date and time of collection.

        **Please Note: The request body is optional when you use this endpoint. You can optionally update the parcel information when setting the shipment as ready-to-ship.**

        This process is particularly useful for on-demand carrier service where the carrier only picks up the shipment once they are notified of the collection schedule.

        The `shipment_id` is used as a path parameter to identify the shipment. Alternatively the merchant provided shipment reference (`partner_shipment_reference`) can also be used instead of the `shipment_id`.

      summary: Update Status
      description: |-
        This status endpoint allows the merchant to update the status of the shipment. This is useful in following scenarios:

        1. To set the merchant controlled status such as "shipped", "delivery_confirmed", and "return_confirmed"
        2. To overide incorrect status received from the carrier. For instance, the carrier incorrectly updated the status as "delivered", the merchant can overide the status to "returned" if the shipment was returned to the merchant
        3. To manually update missing status. For instance, if the merchant is aware that the carrier delivered the shipment but failed to update the system, then the merchant can mannually set the status to "delviered" using this endpoint.

        Please note, that only the following status updates are allowed via this end point

        1. `shipped`, if the current status is one of the following
        * booked
        * ready_to_ship
        * failed_collection_attempt
        2. `out_for_delivery`, if the current status is one of the following
        * shipped
        * in_transit
        * failed_delivery_attempt
        * suspended
        * missing
        3. `delivered`, if the current status is one of the following
        * cancelled
        * shipped
        * in_transit
        * out_for_delivery
        * awaiting_customer_collection
        * failed_delivery_attempt
        * suspended
        * missing
        * delayed
        * returned
        * delivery_confirmed
        4. `delivery_confirmed`, if the current status is one of the following
        * delivered
        5. `return_in_transit`, if the current status is one of the following
        * shipped
        * in_transit
        * out_for_delivery
        * awaiting_customer_collection
        * failed_delivery_attempt
        * ready_for_return
        * suspended
        * missing
        * delayed
        6. `returned`, if the current status is one of the following
        * cancelled
        * shipped
        * in_transit
        * out_for_delivery
        * awaiting_customer_collection

        * missing
        * delayed
        * delivered
        * return_confirmed
        7. `return_confirmed`, if the current status is one of the following
        * returned

        This endpoint allows the merchant to update the scheduled delivery date after the shipment is created.

        The delivery schedule can be updated as long as the shipment is not in a final status (delivered, returned or cancelled), however please note that this information is not passed to the carriers after the shipment is booked, as most carriers do not accept a schedule update after booking.

        It can be set using one of the following options

        Option 1: Provide the `scheduled_from` and `scheduled_to` to choose the scheduled date along with start and end time.

        Example:
        "delivery": {
          "scheduled_from": "2022-01-01'T'10:00:00.000Z",
          "scheduled_to": "2022-01-01'T'12:00:00.000Z"
        }

        Option 2: Provide the `scheduled_date` only to choose the entire day.

        Example:
        "delivery": {
          "scheduled_date": "2022-01-01"
        }

        The `shipment_id` is used as a path parameter to identify the shipment. Alternatively the merchant provided shipment reference (`partner_shipment_reference`) can also be used instead of the `shipment_id`.

        The collection schedule can be updated as long as the shipment is not in a final status (delivered, returned or cancelled), however please note that this information is not passed to the carriers after the shipment is booked, as most carriers do not accept a schedule update after booking.

        It can be set using one of the following options

        Option 1: Provide the `scheduled_from` and `scheduled_to` to choose the scheduled date along with start and end time.

        Example:
        "collection": {
          "scheduled_from": "2022-01-01'T'10:00:00.000Z",
          "scheduled_to": "2022-01-01'T'12:00:00.000Z"
        }

        Option 2: Provide the `scheduled_date` only to choose the entire day.

        Example:
        "collection": {
          "scheduled_date": "2022-01-01"
        }

        The `shipment_id` is used as a path parameter to identify the shipment. Alternatively the merchant provided shipment reference (`partner_shipment_reference`) can also be used instead of the `shipment_id`.

        The carrier list endpoint returns a list of carrier-accounts that you have setup in your Carriyo account. A carrier account can be `inactive` if it is not in use.

        By default, the endpoint returns all active and inactive carrier accounts. The `status` query parameter can be passed to return carrier accounts based on the status. You can pass the following values to the `status` parameter.
        - active
        - inactive
        - deleted

        **Inactive carrier accounts cannot be used for booking. Hence you may want to only fetch active carrier accounts by passing query parameter of `status=active`.**
